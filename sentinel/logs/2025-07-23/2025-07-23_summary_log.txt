→ 1. **Dominant Trend**: The session exhibits a sideways movement with a slight bearish tilt. The initial candles show some volatility, but the latter half of the session sees prices oscillating in a tighter range, indicating consolidation.

→ 2. **Key Liquidity Sweeps or Reversals**: A notable liquidity sweep occurred at 20:35 when prices dipped sharply to a low of 3428.115 before recovering, suggesting a potential stop-loss hunting or a reversal point. Another minor reversal is seen at 20:55, where prices spiked to 3432.005 before closing lower, indicating selling pressure at higher levels.

→ 3. **Fast Wick or Aggressive Volume Shifts**: The candle at 20:55 exhibits an aggressive upward movement with a high wick, indicating a short-lived attempt to break higher, which was quickly met with selling pressure. This suggests that any bullish attempts are being countered effectively by sellers.

→ 4. **Session High/Low Behavior**: The session high of 3432.005 was achieved at 20:55 and was quickly rejected, while the session low of 3427.530 at 22:50 suggests a potential support level being tested. The inability to sustain higher prices indicates resistance near the highs.

→ 5. **Outlook for the Next Session**: The outlook for the next session is **neutral to bearish**. The repeated failure to break higher and the presence of resistance near the session highs suggest that any upward momentum may be limited. Traders should watch for potential breakdowns below the session lows for bearish continuation.
