<b>SENTINEL REPORT</b>

<b>DOMINANT TREND</b>

<b>LIQUIDITY EVENTS</b>
A significant liquidity grab occurred around **<b>3345.47</b>**, which marked the session's high before a reversal. The reversal initiated a sell-off, breaking earlier support levels and trapping late buyers.

<b>VOLUME BEHAVIOUR</b>
Volume spiked during the initial bullish push, suggesting strong buying interest. As the session progressed, volume tapered off, indicating reduced participation and potential buyer exhaustion. The final bearish move was accompanied by a moderate increase in volume, confirming seller dominance.

<b>SESSION RANGE</b>
