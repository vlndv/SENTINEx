→ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

→ 1. **Dominant Trend**: The overall trend during this session appears to be relatively neutral with a slight bullish bias. While there are periods of both upward and downward movements, the session ends with a slight upward movement, evidenced by the closing price of the last candle (3428.095) being higher than the opening price of the first candle (3421.660).

→ 2. **Key Liquidity Sweeps or Reversals**: Notable liquidity sweeps occurred around the 15:00 and 15:05 candles. At 15:00, a significant up move pushed the price from a low of 3423.985 to a high of 3430.055, indicating a possible stop-loss hunt or reversal play. The subsequent candle at 15:05 showed a sharp reversal, closing lower at 3426.520, suggesting a potential exhaustion of the upward momentum.

→ 3. **Fast Wick or Aggressive Volume Shifts**: The candle at 15:00 shows a pronounced wick to the upside, indicating an aggressive volume shift and potential rejection above 3430. This is followed by a rapid sell-off in the next candle, highlighting aggressive profit-taking or short positioning.

→ 4. **Session High/Low Behavior**: The session high was established early at 15:00 with a price of 3430.055, while the session low was at the beginning of the session at 3421.515. The inability to sustain the high above 3430 suggests strong resistance around this level, while the consistent higher lows indicate underlying support and buying interest.

→ 5. **Outlook for the Next Session**: Based on the data, the outlook for the next session is cautiously **neutral** to **slightly bullish**. The market shows resilience with higher lows, but the resistance around 3430 remains a critical barrier. Traders should watch for sustained breaks above 3430 for a bullish continuation or a breakdown below the recent lows for bearish momentum.

→ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

→ 1. **Dominant Trend**: The session exhibits a generally sideways trend with no strong directional bias. While there are brief upward and downward movements, the overall range remains relatively tight between approximately 3424 and 3430, indicating consolidation.

→ 2. **Key Liquidity Sweeps or Reversals**: A notable liquidity sweep occurred during the 15:00 candle, where the price dipped to a low of 3423.985 before rallying to close significantly higher at 3429.765. This suggests a possible stop hunt followed by a quick reversal, absorbing sell-side liquidity and pushing prices higher.

→ 3. **Fast Wick or Aggressive Volume Shifts**: The 16:10 candle displayed aggressive buying with a strong upward wick, pushing the price to a high of 3430.840 before closing lower at 3429.360. This indicates a potential exhaustion of buying momentum or a lack of follow-through at higher levels.

→ 4. **Session High/Low Behavior**: The session high was established at 3430.840 during the 16:10 candle, while the session low was at 3421.920 during the 14:45 candle. The behavior around these levels shows limited interest in sustaining moves beyond these points, reinforcing the sideways range.

→ 5. **Outlook for the Next Session**: The outlook for the next session appears neutral. The lack of a decisive breakout from the consolidation range and the presence of both bullish and bearish wicks suggest that neither buyers nor sellers are currently in control. Traders should watch for a breakout from the 3424-3430 range to determine the next directional bias.

→ 1. **Dominant Trend**: The session exhibited a predominantly sideways trend with minor fluctuations. There was a brief bullish attempt around 15:00 to 15:05, followed by a retraction back to the mean levels. Overall, the market displayed consolidation behavior, with prices oscillating within a relatively tight range.

→ 2. **Key Liquidity Sweeps or Reversals**: Notable liquidity sweeps occurred during the 15:00 candle, where the price dipped to 3423.985 before sharply reversing and reaching a high of 3430.055. This suggests a potential stop-hunt or liquidity grab before reversing. Another reversal is observed at the 16:10 candle, which tested the session's high at 3430.840 before pulling back.

→ 3. **Fast Wick or Aggressive Volume Shifts**: The candle at 15:00 displayed a significant wick on both ends, indicating aggressive buying and selling activity. This suggests a volatile moment where both bulls and bears were actively engaged, likely driven by a high volume of trades.

→ 4. **Session High/Low Behavior**: The session high was established at 3430.840 during the 16:10 candle, while the low was noted at 3421.920 during the 14:45 candle. The high was tested again during the last candles but failed to sustain, indicating strong resistance around the 3430 level.

→ 5. **Outlook for the Next Session**: Considering the sideways movement with occasional upward thrusts, the outlook for the next session is **neutral**. The inability to break and hold above key resistance levels, coupled with equal attempts from both bulls and bears, suggests that the market may continue to consolidate unless a significant catalyst emerges.

→ 1. **Dominant Trend**: The session displayed a predominantly sideways trend with minor fluctuations. Prices oscillated within a relatively tight range, reflecting indecision or consolidation after a previous move. The opening and closing prices of the session were relatively close, indicating a lack of strong directional momentum.
→ 2. **Key Liquidity Sweeps or Reversals**: There were noticeable liquidity sweeps around the 15:10 and 16:10 candles, where prices extended beyond recent highs and lows, indicating potential attempts to capture stop-losses or trigger breakout trades. However, these movements quickly reverted, suggesting a lack of follow-through strength.
→ 3. **Fast Wick or Aggressive Volume Shifts**: The 16:10 candle exhibited a fast wick to the upside, reaching a high of ****3430.840**** before closing significantly lower at ****3429.360****. This indicates an aggressive yet unsustained attempt to push higher, possibly driven by a sudden spike in buy orders that were quickly absorbed.
