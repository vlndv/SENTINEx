<b>**Dominant Trend:</b>

<b>**Key Liquidity Sweeps or Reversals:</b>
** A notable liquidity sweep occurred between 07:15 and 07:30, where the price dropped to a low of 3383.455 before quickly reversing and closing significantly higher at 3386.205. This suggests a potential stop-loss hunt before a bullish reversal.

<b>**Fast Wick or Aggressive Volume Shifts:</b>
** There were aggressive moves around 08:15 to 08:30, where the price reached a high of 3390.160 but closed lower at 3388.305. This indicates a quick rejection of higher prices, possibly due to profit-taking or resistance at those levels.

** The session high was reached at 11:00 with a price of 3388.955, while the session low was at 07:15 with a price of 3383.455.

<b>**Outlook for the Next Session:</b>
** The outlook for the next session appears neutral with a slight bullish bias. The consolidation near session highs and lack of a strong rejection or reversal pattern suggests the market could be preparing for either a continuation higher or a consolidation phase. However, the presence of wicks on the highs suggests caution as resistance may still be significant.
